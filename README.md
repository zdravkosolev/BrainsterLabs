Project Title: BrainsterLabs

Description: This is my first project for Brainster.co

In this Project I used JavaSctipt for the first time and it was realy hard at the beginnig, but after a few online reserch I figure it out how and where to use it.

Step by Step:

First of all I made the Navigation bar where I had to put Brainster Logo which is linked to the same page. In the Navigation bar I also put some links that lead to courses on Brainster.co. In this bar there is button which lead to page where you shoud fill some form with name, contact number, name of the company, type of students from the academy. in this form is specific that if you dont put the right information you get notification under the form which tells you that you putted wrong information.

Under the Navigation bar there is section that have an Image and three sections that filter cards. When you click on the section, by using JS it filters the project cards.
There are 20 card that ar filtered by these three sections. At first there are shown only 6 cards, under the cards there is button "load more". It has a function, when you click on it it load 6 more cards... after showing the 20 cards it disapear from the page.

At the bottom there is footer section.
